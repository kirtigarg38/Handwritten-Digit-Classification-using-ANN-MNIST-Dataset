# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN-MNIST-Dataset
A simple yet effective implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## üìù Description
This project trains an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves high accuracy and includes visualization of predictions.

## ‚ú® Features
- **MNIST Dataset**: Uses the standard MNIST dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
- **ANN Architecture**: Implements a feedforward neural network with input, hidden, and output layers.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Includes model training, validation, and performance metrics (accuracy, loss).
- **Prediction Visualization**: Displays sample test images alongside their predicted labels.
